# UART_project_Verilog
This repository contains the Verilog source code and Vivado project files for a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) module. This project provides a fundamental building block for enabling serial communication between an FPGA and other devices like microcontrollers, PCs, or peripheral sensors.
